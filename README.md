Coded explanations of some of the most popular Interview Questions for Software Engineering Internships in C/Java/Python/Ruby.

## Most important Tree Questions:
- Flatten a Binary Search Tree to sorted Linked List (ascending and descending)
- Convert BST to Max-Heap and Min Heap (using auxiliary space and in-place) (HARD)
- Print a Tree level by level (BFS) and DFS
- Print a Tree in In-order, Post-order, Pre-order fashion
- Convert Sorted Linked List to BST (HARD)
- Check that a tree is a valid BST in O(n) time and O(logN) space (stack call size) (HARD)
- Remove all leaf nodes from BST
- Print leaf nodes from Pre-order traversal array of a BST
- Implement a max/min Heap.
- K numbers with most occurrences in an array (Create Heap) (HARD)
- Check if Binary tree is valid sum tree (HARD)
- Create BST from pre-order and in-order traversal strings (HARD).

## Most important Stack Questions:
- Implement a queue using 2 stacks
- Implement stack such that GetMin() and GetMax() are in O(1) without extra stack (HARD)
- Sort a stack recursively and iteratively (Sorted Insert vs Two Stacks) (HARD)

## Most important Linked List Questions:
- Reverse a Linked List iteratively and recursively
- Check if a Linked List has cycles, and output the first node (HARD)
- Check if a Linked List is a palindrome

## Most important Miscellaneous:

- Print all substrings of a word/string
- Most efficient implementation of Square Root and Exponentiation (HARD)
- All combinations of N balanced paranthesis (HARD)
- Fibonacci iteratively and recursively
- Number of ways to climb stairs using either 1 or 2 (n or m) steps at once

## Most important arrays Questions:
- Intersection and Union of two lists
- Find number which appears odd number of times
- Binary search in a rotated array
- Check if list is rotated version of another list
- Pairs in a list that sum to a number
- Triplets in a list that sum to a number

## Sorting:
- Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort
