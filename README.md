## Most important arrays/strings Questions:
- Check if two strings have a common substring of length N **** (using 2D array and using Suffix Tree)
- Find longest common substring of two strings and its length****
- Intersection and Union of two sorted lists
- Multiply 2 very large numbers represented as strings *O(M x N))*

- Check if list is rotated version of another list
- Pairs in a list that sum to a number (using sorting, hash map)
- Triplets in a list that sum to a number
- Remove all duplicates from a list (use hash map, new list or sorting)
- Print all duplicates from a list of size n, which can contain elements from 0 to n-1. (O(N) time & O(1) space)

## Sorting:
- Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort (HARD), Heap Sort (HARD)
- Stability of different sorts
