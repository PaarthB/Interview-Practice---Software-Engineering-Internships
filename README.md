- Check if Binary tree is valid sum tree (HARD)
- Create BST from pre-order and in-order traversal strings (HARD).
- Convert Max/Min Heap to BST. (HARD)
- Check if BST is subtree of another BST

## Most important Stack Questions:
- Implement a queue using 2 stacks
- Implement stack such that GetMin() and GetMax() are in O(1) without extra stack (HARD)
- Sort a stack recursively and iteratively (Sorted Insert vs Two Stacks) (HARD)

## Most important Linked List Questions:
- Reverse a Linked List iteratively and recursively
- Merge two sorted Linked Lists

- Check if a Linked List is a palindrome

## Most important Miscellaneous:

- Find number which appears odd number of times
- Find max sum interval in an array
- Sum two binary numbers represented as strings and return the resulting binary number.
- Check if array contains a subarray which sums up to a given number
- Check and return the length of the longest consecutive subsequence
- Find maximum sum in array such that no two elements are adjacent (<a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-sum-such-that-no-two-elements-are-adjacent/">Explained</a>)
- Binary search in a rotated array
- Check if list is rotated version of another list
